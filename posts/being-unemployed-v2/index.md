I wrote about being unemployed back in 2020. I was so cute back then. This year has been much more difficult, in more ways than one. I'm lucky that I found a job, so I'm writing this as I start my new gig next week for an _amazing_ team that I will write about in the future.

But I digress. The purpose of this post is to share the differences between my thoughts and experience with my job hunt this time around.

There are two major outside factors affecting me (over which I have no control):

1. The economy "post" pandemic still hasn't
2. Giant layoffs of big-tech overhiring during the pandemic are rippling throughout the industry. The talent pool is heavily saturated.

Personal factors:

1. I needed a break.
2. I wanted to continue as an engineering manager
